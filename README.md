# philogenetic_trees

This project contains the implementation of a bioinformatics algorithm for finding phylogenetic trees using Maximum Parsimony. 
The scoring algorithm used is Fitch scoring algorithm. 

Three types of implementations exist in this project: 

1. Exhaustive search
2. Branch and bound search
3. Parallel branch and bound search

The entire project is coded in MATLAB.
